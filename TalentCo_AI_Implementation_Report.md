## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Data Model Excellence

**Domain-Driven Design** with clean separation:
- **`profiles/`** - Talent domain (Profile, ProfileExperience, ProfileSkill, ProfileExperienceSkill)
- **`opportunities/`** - Job domain (Opportunity, OpportunitySkill, OpportunityExperience)  
- **`organisations/`** - Company domain (Organisation)
- **`skills/`** - Skills taxonomy (Skill)
- **`evaluations/`** - Matching/scoring domain (EvaluationSet, Evaluation)
- **`memories/`** - AI memory system for agents

### Advanced Matching Pipeline

**Multi-Stage Evaluation Process:**

1. **Structured Matching (60% weight)** - Fast skills overlap analysis
2. **Semantic Matching (40% weight)** - Vector similarity using OpenAI embeddings
3. **LLM Judge** - Top 20% candidates get expensive GPT-4 evaluation with reasoning

**Temporal Weighting:** Recent experience gets higher relevance scores using sophisticated recency and duration algorithms.

**Vector Embeddings:** 1536-dimensional embeddings for granular "like-to-like" comparisons:
- ProfileSkill ↔ OpportunitySkill  
- ProfileExperience ↔ OpportunityExperience
- ProfileExperienceSkill ↔ Job requirements

### AI Agent Framework

**Current Agent:** Career guidance specialist with memory tools
**Planned:** Dual-agent system (Employer Agent + Candidate Agent) with comprehensive tool suites
