# Frustrations with Current Job Listing Platforms

**Email from Neil Salisbury - July 11, 2024**

## Frustrations with current jobs listing platforms:

1. No feedback after applying, leaving candidates wondering if their application was even seen
2. Vague requirements and responsibilities that don't accurately reflect the actual role
3. Poor filtering leads to constant notifications for unsuitable positions
4. Jobs that have already been filled but remain posted for weeks
5. ATS systems that misinterpret skills, experience, and formatting
6. No personalization based on career stage, industry, or preferences
7. Superficial information about company culture, team dynamics, and growth opportunities
8. Ineffective skills matching
9. Hundreds of unqualified applications for each posting
10. Poor candidate screening - Platforms don't effectively filter for relevant skills and experience
11. High competition - Bidding wars for top talent with limited differentiation tools
12. Expensive premium features - Core functionality locked behind costly subscriptions
13. Transactional interactions rather than ongoing talent relationships
14. Inadequate features for building inclusive hiring practices
15. No verification if it's a real or virtual person
16. Clunky process to sort, shortlist and interview candidates
17. No clear pathway for candidates who want to transition to relevant jobs in the climate ESG and broader sustainability space
