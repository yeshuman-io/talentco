# APIs for TalentCo

**Notes from TalentCo's founder Neil Salisbury**

These are the APIs for the POC

| Category | Website | Comment |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Candidate profiles | Coresignal<br/>https://coresignal.com/ | Whether we access their free version first for the POC we can then decide how we generate the two sided marketplace |
| Job posting, candidate profiles and company profiles | Indeed, https://au.indeed.com | This is to access all three categories. I am not sure if there is a paid version for this not clear on the website |
| Job posting, candidate profiles and company profiles | Glassdoor,<br/>https://www.glassdoor.com/ | This also provides candidate feedback on companies which is valuable to capture |
| Job posting, candidate profiles and company profiles | linkedin | They have locked this down so may not have much luck here |
| Other posting sites | Seek, Monster Jobs, job adder etc | |
| Educational APIs | https://sdgacademy.org/courses/ | Free courses |
| Educational APIs | https://www.coursera.org/ | This is likely to be via an API |
